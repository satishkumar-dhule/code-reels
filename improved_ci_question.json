  "question": "What is Continuous Integration and why is it essential for modern software development?",
  "answer": "Continuous Integration (CI) automates building and testing code changes multiple times daily to catch issues early and maintain code quality.",
  "explanation": "**Continuous Integration (CI)** is a development practice where developers frequently integrate code changes into a central repository, with automated builds and tests validating each integration.\n\n## Key Benefits:\n- **Early bug detection** - Issues caught immediately after commit\n- **Reduced integration conflicts** - Small, frequent changes prevent merge hell\n- **Improved code quality** - Automated tests enforce standards\n- **Faster feedback loops** - Developers know quickly if changes work\n- **Consistent builds** - Automated process eliminates environment differences\n\n## Core Practices:\n- Maintain single source repository\n- Automate build and test processes\n- Commit to mainline daily\n- Keep builds fast and reliable\n- Test in production-like environment\n- Make results visible to entire team",
