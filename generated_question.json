  "question": "Explain the difference between `is` and `==` in Python and provide an example where they give different results.",
  "answer": "`is` checks object identity (same memory address), `==` checks equality (same value). `a = [1,2]; b = [1,2]; a == b` is True, `a is b` is False.",
  "explanation": "In Python, `==` compares the values of two objects using their `__eq__` method, while `is` compares their memory addresses using the `id()` function. For immutable objects like small integers and strings, Python often optimizes by reusing the same object, making `is` and `==` appear equivalent. However, for mutable objects or larger values, they typically differ. Understanding this distinction is crucial for debugging and avoiding subtle bugs in Python code.",
